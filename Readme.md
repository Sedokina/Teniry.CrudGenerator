# ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can install the package via NuGet:

```
Install-Package Teniry.CrudGenerator
```

# ðŸ”¨ Quick start

* Create domain model
* Create DBContext
* Create basic configuration
* Build a project
* ðŸš€ Done! You have working CRUD API!

Add the following code to your `Program.cs` file, to register all necessary services for library to work

```csharp
using AutogeneratedEndpoints;

// your configuration
// ...

// This required because generated code uses CQRS pattern library
builder.Services.AddCqrs();

// This required to provide generated endpoints to the application
app.MapGeneratedEndpoints();

// your other app.Map() calls
// ...
```

# FAQ

## Who is this library for and would it be a good fit for my project?

This library is for developers who want to quickly generate CRUD for their application.

It would fit you if:

* You need to create a simple CRUD for a small project
* You want to create a prototype quickly
* You have a large project that includes lots of entities that requires CRUD operations and don't include much business
  logic
* You want to focus on the business logic, don't want to write a lot of boilerplate code for an application, and stay
  flexible in the same time

## What is the difference between this library and other libraries that generate CRUD?

This library is based on the CQRS pattern and generates code that is easy to understand and maintain.
It generates only the necessary endpoints and handlers, which makes the code more readable and maintainable.
It also provides a way to customize the configuration to fit your needs.

## Is it production ready?

Yes! Teniry.CodeGenerator is production ready. But it would be fair to notice that it is quite new library and it may
lack some features that you might need.
